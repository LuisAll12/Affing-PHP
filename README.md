# Affing with PHP
##### Hackathon 2024 Lucerne(Neubad)
---

This project was developed at a hackathon in Lucerne 2024. Me and my team were able to develop this affiliate marketing tool in 30 hours, without any prior knowledge of php. My 4 team colleagues mainly worked on the backend. 
It was a lot of fun and we would do it again.
